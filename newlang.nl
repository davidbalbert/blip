// TODO: What about float16? There are multiple different float16 types in C.
//
// Unsized ints (int, uint), must be cast to a specific C type.

// Go has complex64 and complex128. Not sure if we want those.


// An array. E.g. [5]int. Size is known statically.
[N]T

// A slice. E.g. []int. Length and capacity are stored in the slice.
// TODO:
// - Can slices be nil, like Go?
// - Should slices be mutable? I think so.
[]T

// A map. E.g. map[string]int. Alt: dict[string]int.
map[K]V

// A string. No assumed encoding. Source files are always UTF-8, and thus string literals are as well. Strings
// are null-terminated, and can be bridged to C without copying. Like slices, strings store their length and
// capacity, which can be queried in constant time.

// - What should this be? In Go it's an immutable []byte. If you iterate you get runes.

// Unions also support types without an explicit tag name. This is conceptually equivalent to something
// like `Conn | File`. Unlike structs, methods are not promoted. Instead, consider interfaces, or if you
// have a union, pattern matching.

// Note: if we decide to enable method promotion on unions, we should only do it when the union is composed
// entirely of embedded types, and when the method is present on every type in the union.

// Should you be able to use nocopy on variable declarations?
var i (nocopy int) = 5

// Pros:
// - You definitely need to be able to use nocopy on pointer declarations: `var p (nocopy *int)`. This creates
//   a nice symmetry.
// - It also creates a symmetry with type declarations. If type declarations are creating new names* for another
//   type, it stands that anything you can say in a type declaration, you should be able to say in a variable
//   declaration too.
//   *This is a lie. Type declarations create new types, not new names. Does this invalidate the above pro?
//
// Cons:
// - If you have a nocopy type like Fd, then `var f (nocopy Fd)` is redundant. Is it allowed? My hunch is no, but
//   I'm not sure.
// - It might create a false sense of symmetry with pointer variables. Borrowed, counted, weak, etc. can only be
//   used on pointers. Maybe we should have type modifiers and pointer modifiers and only allow type modifiers
//   in type declarations.

// If the answer to the above is yes, is this allowed? It's redundant.
var f (nocopy Fd)


// How are nocopy types printed in an IDE?
var i (nocopy int) // "(nocopy int)"
var f Fd           // "Fd (nocopy)". Or maybe just "Fd"? The former has less symmetry, but is more helpful, so I
                   // think it's better.

// Pointers

// A borrowed pointer. Panic on nil dereference. No action on drop. Cannot outlive the value it
// points to, which means unless we have some sort of support for lifetime dependencies, it can't
// be escaped. Passing to C is unsafe, but allowed. When passed to C, the programmer is responsible
// responsible for ensuring that it doesn't escape.
//
// TODO: How is it passed to C? Options:
// - automatically cast to (unsafe *T)

// A pointer with unknown ownership. The programmer is responsible for managing the memory. Panics
// on nil dereference, but use-after-free is possible. C pointers are imported as unsafe.
(unsafe *int)
     
// An owned pointer. Just like other noncopy types, it must be consumed or escaped. Just like it's
// possible to borrow a nocopy type, it's possible to borrow a nocopy pointer.

(counted *int)  // A refcounted pointer. Alt: (rc *int), (strong *int). Never nil.

// In pseudocode, a refcounted pointer is a pointer to a struct struct that's stored on the heap. The count
// is updated atomically.
struct {

// To make a refcounted pointer, use the rc builtin. The type passed to rc is copied into the refcounted struct.
// If it's a pointer, the pointer is copied. If it's a value, the value is copied.
func rc(v T) (counted *T)

// You can also supply a cleanup function that will be called when the refcount reaches 0.
func rc(v T, cleanup func(v T)) (counted *T)

// Refcounted pointers can own nocopy types, and must provide a cleanup function to consume the
// owned value.

// You can also integrate external reference counted types by providing custom retain and release functions.
func rc(v T, retain func(v T), release func(v T)) (counted *T)

// A custom refcounted pointer has a different layout in memory:
struct {

}

// You can make a weak reference using the weak builtin

p2 := &x                  // multiple borrows of a stack allocated value is ok. typeof(p2) is *int

// A local variable can be moved into an owned pointer, in which case the original variable is consumed. Escape
// analysis is performed. If the variable escapes (e.g. is returned) or is consumed by a function, it will be
// heap allocated.
var x int
var p (nocopy *int) = &x // may be stack or heap allocated
print(x)                 // error: x was moved to p. It doesn't matter that x is copyable.

// To force heap allocation, use make.

// You can borrow an owned pointer
var x int
