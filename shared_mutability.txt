There's a nasty bug in this code:

func appendReset(s *[]int, p *int) {
    append(s, *p)
    *p = 0
}

If p points at an element of s, and append reallocates, p could become invalid. Use after free!

So what should we do? One option is to copy Rust and enforce single writer multi reader. S would be a &mut Vec, and thus p would be guaranteed not to alias with s.

But I don't love that approach. Specifically, I want to be able to write this:

func swap(a, b *int) {
    *b, *a = *a, *b
}

s := []int{1, 2}
swap(&s[0], &s[1])

In Rust, this is a compile error because &s[0] and &s[1] are both mutable borrows of s, and that's not allowed.

But Rust is overly restrictive. The above code is safe. In a single threaded environment, it's not possible for s's storage to get reallocated during the call to swap.

Is there a path forward? Yes! Ante allows for safe mutable aliasing: https://antelang.org/blog/safe_shared_mutability/. We'll do the same, but with our own twist.

Two types of borrows:

shared: *int
unique: uniq *int // Alt: my *int

Unique borrows must be statically known to not alias.

s := []int{1, 2}
var u (uniq *[]int) = &s
var s1 *[]int = &s        // error: s is uniquely borrowed by u

var b1 *[]int = &s        // error: s is uniquely borrowed by u
var b2 *[]int = &u[0]     // error: u is unique and can't be borrowed

On the other hand, shared borrows are fine:

s := []int{1, 2}
var s1 *[]int = &s
var s2 *[]int = &s // ok!

We can define append to take a unique slice:

func append(slice uniq *[]T, v T) { ... }

This means we can't append to a borrowed slice (which is a restriction we've already set out in the spec):

s := []int{1, 2}
append(&s, 3) // ok! s becomes unique

s := []int{1, 2}
s1 := &s      // *[]int
append(&s, 3) // error: s1 borrows s, so &s cannot be unique.

Annoyingly, the above is safe, but doesn't fit the model. We have two pointers to the slice, but no pointers into the slice.

s := []int{1, 2}
var s1 *[]int = &s
append(s1, 3) // error: s1 is *[]int but expected uniq *[]int


Ante is polymorphic on uniqueness. In Ante, there is &own T, and &shared T. But own isn't a subtype of shared. Instead, a function taking &T is polymorphic on uniquness. I think it might work like this, but I'm not sure.

func foo(p *T) *T {}
var p1 uniq *T = ...
var p2 shared *T = ...

typeof(foo(p1)) // uniq *T
typeof(foo(p2)) // shared *T

Or at least, I think it's something like that. Do we need it?



## Some ideas about refcounted pointers

uniq #*T // a #*T with a known refcount of 1. The `rc` builtin should return a uniq #*T

A uniq #*T can be coerced into a uniq *T. E.g.

s := #*[]int{1, 2} // typeof(s) == uniq #*[]int
append(s, 3) // ok!

It can also be borrowed explicitly:

s := #*[]int{1, 2}
b := &*s // typeof(b) == uniq *[]int

If you borrow twice, it's shared:

s := #*[]int{1, 2}
b1 := &*s // typeof(b1) == *[]int
b2 := &*s // ditto

A non-uniq refcounted pointer can't be borrowed uniquely:

s1 := #*[]int{1, 2} // typeof(s1) == #*[]int
s2 := s1            // ditto
append(s1, 3) // error: s1 is not unique.

We need the equivalent of Arc::make_mut to give us a uniquely referenced thing.

var s #*[]int = ...
s1 := uniq(s)   // typeof(s1) == uniq #*[]int.
b1 := &*uniq(s) // typeof(b1) == uniq *[]int.

Both of these forms copy the underlying slice if necessary and update the `s` to point at the new data. In either form, s can't be used until the last use of s1 or b1. Alt: uniqify. You can also choose to shadow s:

var s #*[]int = ...
s := uniq(s)   // typeof(s1) == uniq #*[]int.
s := &*uniq(s) // typeof(b1) == uniq *[]int.

// Assetions. Panics if refcount != 1.
var s #*[]int = ...
s1 := s.(uniq)   // typeof(s1) == uniq #*[]int. Panics if refcount != 1. s can only be used after the last use of s1.
append(s.(uniq), 3) // Ditto. Panics if refcount != 1.
b1 := &*s.(uniq) // typeof(b1) == uniq *[]int. Panics if refcount == 1


Do we need an equivalent of Arc::get_mut?

var s #*[]int = ...
s1, ok := s.(uniq)   // typeof(s1) == uniq #*[]int. If refcount != 1, s1 == nil and ok == false.
b1, ok := &*s.(uniq) // typeof(b1) == uniq *[]int. Ditto.



## Having our cake and eating it too

Is there another point in the design space where typeof(&s[5]) == *int and append takes an *[]int? Here's an unsound sketch, but it's a start.

func append(s *[]T, v T) // append takes a shared pointer
func swap(a *T, b *T)

s := []int{1, 2}
append(&s, 3) // typeof(&s) == *[]int

p1 := &s[0] // typeof(p1) == *int
p2 := &s[1]
swap(p1, p2)

append(&s, 4)
// don't use p1 or p2 after this point

There aren't any problems here. Could this work? If borrowing through a pointer (e.g. &s[1]) temporarily made typeof(s) == const []int until p1 and p2 were dropped, then maybe this could work?

A problem:

func bad(a, b *[]int) {
    p := &a[0]
    append(b, 10) // if a and b alias, p could dangle.
}

s := []int{1, 2}
s1 := &s
s2 := &s

bad(s1, s2) // no good! We don't have any guarantees that a and b don't alias.

It's probably not worth the squeeze. A slice needs to be uniq in order to append
.
