//
// Non-copyable types are move-only. They must be escaped or explicitly consumed. Non-copyable types are
// useful for types that manage resources and must be cleaned up later, like a net.Conn that ownes a

// If a type embeds a non-copyable type, it is also non-copyable. The type mem.NoCopy is a zero-sized
// non-copyable type. C.f. structs.HostLayout in Go. To make a non-copyable struct, embed mem.NoCopy:
type Fd struct {
    mem.NoCopy
    fd int
}

// Because Fd is non-copyable, Conn is non-copyable too:
type Conn {
    fd Fd
    // ...
}

// An example:
var a Fd = open(...)
b := a
a.Read(...) // error: a was moved to b
b.Read(...) // ok

// Unions are non-copyable if any of their associated values are also non-copyable. You can also make a
// union non-copyable by including mem.NoCopy as an unamed case:
union {

// Enums are always copyable.

// In an IDE, a non-copyable type is displayed like this: "Fd (nocopy)"


// Math

// Arethmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, etc.) are defined to trap on overflow (TODO: which ones?).
// .+, .-, and .* (more?) wrap on overflow.
//
// TODO: what about a way to explicitly check the overflow flag, e.g. math.Overflow()? If we do that, what does
// that mean in the following cases:
// - Array operations (see below)
// - Compound expressions (e.g. a + b*c)
// - etc.


// Array math

// Arrays (of the same size? what about slices?) be operated on like J or APL, only using wrapping operators.
[3]int{1, 2, 3} .+ [3]int{4, 5, 6} // [3]int{5, 7, 9}

// You can also operate on arrays with scalars. The scalar can be on either side of the operator.
[3]int{1, 2, 3} .+ 1 // [3]int{2, 3, 4}

// This gives some simple high-level ways to express SIMD operations. For more control, there should be a
// "simd" package


// Pointers

// There are 5 pointer types: owned, borrowed, unsafe, reference counted, and weak. All pointer types can be nil.
// Dereferencing a nil pointer is defined behavior – it panics. All pointers besides unsafe pointers have temporal
// safety – they prevent use-after-free.

$*int       // owned
*int        // borrowed
!*int       // unsafe
#*int       // reference counted
(weak *int) // weak

// Other possible spellings and pointer types
~*int // weak
%*int // Non-null, if we add it. Would this be borrowed or owned? Would we need both? Can we get away without this?

// Owned pointers
//
// Owned pointers own the memory they point to, and are responsible for freeing that memory, and disposing of the
// underlying object when they go out of scope. A piece of memory can have exactly one owner. Owned pointers are
// move-only. This ensures that the "single owner" invariant holds. Owned pointers can be passed as arguments to
// functions or returned. Because they are move-only, doing either transfers ownership of the referenced memory.
//
// When an owned pointer goes out of scope, the memory it refers to is freed. This is true whether the memory it
// points to is on the stack or the heap. Owned pointers to nocopy types must be explicitly dropped. Owned pointers
// to copiable types are dropped implicitly.
//
// To pass an owned pointer to a C function, you must explicitly cast it to an unsafe pointer. This makes the C
// function responsible for freeing its memory. This cast is considered a move, and the owned pointer can no longer
// be refered to after the cast.
//
// Owned pointers can be set to nil, or to a new address. If the pointer was non-nil previously, the memory it pointed
// to is freed. You can not set an owned pointer to nil or a new address if it is being borrowed.

// Borrowed pointers
//
// Borrowed pointers can be created from owned pointers as well as non-pointers, and can't outlive the value they
// point to. No action is performed on drop, and they never have to be dropped explicitly. Borrowed pointers can be
// passed to C functions without a cast – they are implicitly converted to unsafe pointers. When passed to C,
// the programmer is responsible for ensuring that if the pointer is escaped, it doesn't outlive its referent.
//
// Borrwed pointers can never have their address changed.

// Unsafe pointers
//
// Unsafe pointers have unknown ownership. The programmer is responsible for freeing the memory when appropriate.
// They still panic on nil dereference, but use-after-free is possible. All C pointers are imported as unsafe.
// Alt: (unsafe *T), (raw *T), (unowned *T).


// Reference counting

// In pseudocode, a refcounted pointer is a pointer to a struct struct that's stored on the heap. The count
// is updated atomically.
struct {
    refcount int
    cleanup func(T)
    value T
}

// To make a refcounted pointer, use the rc builtin. The refcounted struct is allocated on the heap and the
// bytes of v are copied in. You can also pass in an owned pointer. In these forms, T must be copyable.
func rc(v T) #*T
func rc(p $*T) #*T

// You can also supply a cleanup function that will be called when the refcount reaches 0. In this form, T may
// be non-copyable.
func rc(v T, cleanup func(v T)) #*T
func rc(p $*T, cleanup func(v $*T)) #*T

// You can also integrate external reference counted types by providing custom retain and release functions.
//
// IsRetained should be true if the value or pointer is given to you with a +1 refcount.
func rc(v T, retain func(v T), release func(v T), isRetained bool) #*T
func rc(p !*T, retain func(p !*T), release func(p !*T), isRetained bool) #*T

// A custom refcounted pointer has a different layout in memory:
struct {
    retain func(T)
    release func(T)
    value T
}

// You can make a weak reference using the weak builtin
//
// TODO: how to make weak references to custom refcounted pointers? We need to know when the refcount reaches 0
// so we can nil out the weak pointers. One option: weak pointers could be nil'd out as soon as the number of
// #*T pointers (i.e. the number of strong references from Newlang code) drops to 0. This is a bit ugly though:
// if some C code is holding a strong reference, the weak pointer will be nil'd out even though the object is
// still alive.
func weak(p #*T) (weak *T)

p := = rc(5) // typeof(p) is #*int
w := weak(p)  // typeof(w) is (weak *int)

p := rc(fd, close) // typeof(p) is #*Fd


// Pointer conversions

// A variable can be borrowed multiple times.
var x int
p1 := &x           // typeof(p1) == *int
var p2 *int = &x  // type can be explicitly specified

// A local variable can be moved into an owned pointer, in which case the original variable is consumed. Escape
// analysis is performed. If the variable escapes (e.g. is returned) or is consumed by a function, it will be
// heap allocated.
var x int
var p $*int = &x  // may be stack or heap allocated
print(x)          // error: x was moved to p. It doesn't matter that x is copyable.

// Another syntax for the above
var x int
p := (*int)(&x)

// TOOD: I don't love that the type of &x can be either $*int or *int depending on its context. But I do want
// the following examples to work, and they seem to require it. This could be solved by having another operator
// in addition to '&'.

func foo() $*int {
    var x int
    return &x // x is heap allocated
}

func bar($*int) { ... }
func foo() {
    var x int
    bar(&x) // x is heap allocated
}


// Taking the address of a literal works the same way. If it escapes, it's heap allocated, otherwise it's
// stack allocated. Either way, the pointer is owned.
var p $*int = &5
p := &5

// You can't borrow a literal value
var p *int = &5 // error: you cannot borrow a literal

// To force heap allocation, use make.
p := make(int) // typeof(p) is $*int. The int is on the heap.


// You can borrow an owned pointer.
var x int
p1 := ($*int)(&x)
var p2 *int = p1

// On the other hand, if a variable has been borrowed, it can't be moved into an owned pointer.
var x int
p1 := &x           // typeof p1 is *int
var p2 $*int = &x  // error: p1 borrows x, so p2 can't own it.


// Passing pointers to C functions.

// void inc(int *p);
func inc(p !*int)

// To call inc with a borrowed pointer, do the following.
var x int
p := &x    // typeof(p) is *int
inc(p.!)

// This also works with refcounted pointers. The reference count is not incremented.
p := rc(5) // typeof(p) is #*int
inc(p.!)

// And weak pointers:
p := rc(5)
w := weak(p)
inc(w.!)

// In all of these cases, you must ensure that the unsafe pointer doesn't outlive the value it points to. The
// easiest way to do this is to make sure inc doesn't escape the pointer. If call a function that does escape
// the pointer, you must ensure that the pointer's referent lives at least as long as the unsafe pointer does.

// Owned pointers can also be passed to C functions, but the conversion causes ownership to be transferred. Unless
// you free the memory later, it will be leaked. Freeing the memory can be tricky – it depends on what allocator
// allocated the memory.
p := &5
inc(p.!) // $*int -> !*inc
// p has leaked

// An unsafe pointer of any type can be used where an unsafe void pointer is expected.
// void printptr(void *p);

// Receiving pointers from C functions.

// Consider the following:

// struct Node;
// char *get_name(struct Node *node);
func get_name(node !*C.Node) !*C.char

// Node owns its name. In other words, the !*C.char returned by get_name is a borrow by convention. Callers
// of get_name must ensure that the name doesn't outlive the node. While it's possible to use the unsafe

n := &C.Node{}           // typeof(n) is $*C.Node

s1 := get_name(n)      // typeof(s1) is !*C.char
s2 := get_name(n) in n // error: cannot bind lifetime of borrow to an unsafe pointer


// Consider the following:
//
// char *copy_name(struct Node *node);
func copy_name(node !*C.Node) !*C.char

// The semantics of copy_name is that the caller owns the returned string and is responsible for freeing it.
// You can convert the unsafe pointer to an owned pointer using unsafe.Claim:
func Claim(p !*T, alloc mem.Allocator) $*T

n := &C.Node{}
s1 := copy_name(n.!)                   // typeof(s1) is !*C.char
s2 := unsafe.Claim(s1, mem.CAllocator) // typeof(s2) is $*C.char.

// mem.CAllocator is a built-in allocator that uses C.malloc and C.free.
//
// TODO: It's a bit wierd for mem to depend on C, but I can't think of anything better. Some options:
// C.Allocator is probably the clearest, but I think it's bad to have a type in the C that's not actually
// a C type. unsafe.CAllocator might also work. It goes with unsafe.Claim, but nothing about it is
// actually unsafe.

// You can also free the string manually:
n := &C.Node{}
s := copy_name(n.!) // typeof(s1) is !*C.char.
defer C.free(s)

// If you don't do this, s will leak.


// TODO: Iterators and loops
//
// For custom data structures, I want Go-style coroutine-based internal-iteration by default. But we're going
// to be able to convert those into external iterators. The question is how to make sure the underlying data
// structure is retained by the iterator. The answer is that the iterator should borrow the data structure
// and that should keep it alive. It's a good test for the lifetime system. It has to be at least that expressive.
//
// Should borrows be non-nil or nilable? Thoughts:
//
// - In Go, you can call a method on a nil pointer. It's sometimes useful, but how useful?
// - If we want to have a data structure that borrows another one (which we do), that field will be a
//   borrowed pointer. If we want to have zero-value initialization by default (which we do), that field will
//   have to be able to be nil. That's the zero value for any pointer type.
//
// So what does this mean for lifetimes? An owned pointer can be nil. If you borrow it, the borrow will be
// nil too.
//
// One problem with the above: what's the best way to make a doubly linked list? One option: use #*List for next
// and (weak *List) for prev. That's what Swift would do (modulo whatever's going on in indirect enums). Could you
// have
//
// Owned pointers are freed when they go out of scope. Their memory must also be freed when set to nil or overwritten
// with another value. This means it has to be an error to make an owned pointer point to a new location or nil while
// it is being borrowed. Ditto for a borrowed pointer – we can't nil out a borrowed pointer or update the location it.
// points to. But we can update its fields.
//

// Is it possible to mutate while iterating? Here's a stardard, immutable for loop:
for n := range []int{10, 20, 30} {
    // n is the value
}

for i, n := range []int{10, 20, 30} {
    // i is the index, n is the value
}

// Ways to mutate in Go

for i, _ := range nums {
    if nums[i] == 20 {
        nums[i] == 50
    }
}

// If we could borrow the value, then we wouldn't have to use index above. That on its own doesn't seem valuable enough,
// but it would be valuable on a custom data structure, e.g. a linked list.
//
// Maybe something like this? Is this useful enough?
nums := []int{10, 20, 30}
for &n := range nums {
    if *n == 20 {
        *n = 50
    }
}

// For custom data structures using range-over-func, it might be as simple as having the yield signatures be
func() bool
func(*V) bool
func(K, *V) bool

// If you define a yield function for one of the pointer variants, it can still work with the loop variable `n` instead of `&n`.
// It would just be an implicit dereference.
//
// I'm not sure if there are lifetime issues here. What if the values have borrows in them?
//
// This doesn't support inserting or removing. That's too much of a lift. Use a data structure specific Cursor (or maybe Iterator)
// and custom methods.
//
// All that said, maybe this is too hard and too much. Go doesn't have mutable iterators, and after all, you can do everything
