Goal:
- bounds check all pointer accesses, not just slices
- runtime traps for alias violations

- if we disallow pointer arithmetic, we should be able to do this without the below metadata, with the exception of unsafe pointers and integer pointer conversions
- that said, slices can alias
- pointers to fields inside a struct can alias the struct.

How to do this?
- Track all allocations including nested allocations (e.g. malloc inside mmap)
- add metadata at the beginning of each allocation (or elsewhere)
- functions that take any pointer type take a second argument describing that pointer’s extent
- exported C functions wrap the Blip function and pass in nil (or another sentinel value) that signals to Blip that it can’t perform a bounds check

Questions:
- how to deal with custom allocators? If we have a slab allocator, the whole point is to have a bunch of known-sized objects right next to each other. Make() could still ask the allocator for a bit more space, but that might mess up alignment and give people less control of their memory.
    - Maybe instead keep allocation metadata somewhere else.
- How to deal with integer/pointer conversions (see paper below)?
- How to deal with taking a pointer into an array allocation? Maybe same as slab allocation?
- How to deal with A pointer into a field of a struct? Is it valid to increment it passed the field? Is that necessary?
- If we’re storing metadata for our own unsafe pointers, how do we know the difference between those and ones that come from C? Libcrunch?

Which pointer operations are actually necessary?

Ideas:
- All memory that’s mapped in by the loader (text, globals, etc) have known extents loaded into memory.
- have a construct for specifying device-mapped memory. I.e. hardcoding an address for a memory-mapped register bank.
